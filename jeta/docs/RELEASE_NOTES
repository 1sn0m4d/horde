The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Jeta
SSH Module version H3 (1.0-RC2).

Jeta is the Horde wrapper around various Java SSH applets.  It allows users
to login via a terminal window to the server on which the Horde application is
running.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.
This version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist
in the code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
will still change before the final release.
