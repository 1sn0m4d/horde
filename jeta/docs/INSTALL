This document contains instructions for installing Jeta on your system.

Jeta is based on a java SSH client.  It allows shell access to your
web server, or to another machine if used with a port relay daemon
(not provided).

For information on the capabilities and features of Jeta, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Jeta distribution.


Obtaining Jeta
==============

Jeta can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/jeta/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/jeta/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Jeta are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Jeta **REQUIRES** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Jeta runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   before installing Jeta.

   .. Important:: Jeta requires at least version 4.0 of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Jeta's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Jeta.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/


2. A running, working SSH server on the web server, supporting SSH version 1
   protocol. Jeta requires SSH version 1 protocol at this time.  If you have an
   SSH version 2 server, it must provide SSH version 1 failover.

3. A relayd server installed, running, and working on the web server IF AND
   ONLY IF you want to relay to a secondary machine.


Installing Jeta
===============

Jeta is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Jeta is installed directly underneath Horde in the web
server's document tree.

Since Jeta is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/jeta-1.x.tar.gz
   mv jeta-1.x jeta

and would then find Jeta at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/jeta/


Configuring Jeta
================

1. Configuring Horde for Jeta

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['jeta']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Jeta relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Configuring Jeta

   To configure Jeta, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file.  You may edit these files if you wish to customize Jeta's
   appearance and behavior.  With one exceptions (``backends.php``) the
   defaults will be correct for most sites.

   You must be sure to configure an appropriate backend in ``backends.php``.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Jeta.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``File Manager`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate File Manager Configuration`` to
   generate Jeta configuration directory or file, it will not be able to
   write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one
   of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``jeta/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Jeta uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Securing Jeta

   Review the guidelines for security contained in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_.

4. Tuning Jeta (Performance)

   See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_.

5. Additional Notes (relaying SSH connections)

   .. Important:: The Horde Project cannot provide support for configuration
                  of a relay daemon.

   Since Java only allows you to connect back to the web server from which
   the applet was downloaded, if you wish to connect to another machine you
   must use a "transparent redirection" application of some sort.  The standard
   unix tool for this use is the xinetd server.  If you are not running xinetd,
   there are many other redirections tools you can use, some of which can be
   downloaded from the web site at http://www.javassh.org/.  The "relayd" and
   "mrealyd" applications available there are C applications and should be
   fairly portable.

   To configure xinetd, use a configuration similar to the following::

      # default: off
      # description: The relayd deamon redirects ssh connections on port "relayd" \
      #              (relayd must be defined in /etc/services) on this host to \
      #              the ssh server on host 10.0.0.2 on port 22.
      service relayd
      {
          disabl           = no
          flags            = REUSE
          socket_type      = stream
          wait             = no
          user             = root
          server           = /usr/sbin/sshd
          log_on_success   += HOST DURATION
          log_on_failure   += HOST
          bind             = 10.0.0.1
          redirect         = 10.0.0.2 22
      }

   The above accpets connections from the java applet to the web server with
   the IP address 10.0.0.1 (on the port "relayd" as defined in /etc/services)
   and then redirects those connections to a second server at IP address
   10.0.0.2 on port 22.
