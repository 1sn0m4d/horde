+ This repository is deprecated

This is the old, monolith Horde repository that used to contain all Horde components, i.e. all Horde libraries and applications in one single repository. It's still completely available in read-only mode.

For any new development use the separate Git repositories at https://github.com/horde and the Horde Git Tools at https://github.com/horde/git-tools.
