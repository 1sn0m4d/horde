Hippo will be a new Horde 4, PHP 5 application that aggregates content. It will initially be written to aggregate feeds, both internal from Jonah natively, and external (through Horde_Feed). Hippo will work with Horde_Content types and have Input and Output classes. Input classes will allow reading a content type, such as Horde_Feed feeds, Jonah internal feeds, comics, etc. Output classes will allow outputting a "remixed" feed from one or more inputs (such as combining an RSS feed with a few comics into a daily feed).

    * There will be no direct storage of inputs or outputs, but Horde_Cache will be used.
    * Some content types such as comics might include code to fetch and store themselves locally; we might decide that Horde_Feed external feeds should be fetched into a local content table also
    * This application should be able to provide the backend for Planet Horde (http://planet.horde.org/)
    * Fields to aggregate for feeds: title, url, uid, summary, content if any, content-type for content, date
    * During Hippo runs, Horde_Log will be used for logging
    * There will be the ability to run filters on Hippo_Input plugins. For instance, if a certain feed has the same junk in every entry, a filter could be attached to the Hippo_Input for that feed that would strip it out. Generic (regex-type) filters should be configurable via the UI; it should be possible to configure any kind of filter in a config file or separate input plugin class.
    * This application should eventually be able to replace Klutz
    * Additional possible content types include podcasts, content from other Horde applications (iCalendar data from Kronolith), "friend information (http://hasin.wordpress.com/2008/05/31/building-friendfeed-using-php-part-1/, http://hasin.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/building-services-like-friendfeed-using-php-part2/), etc.

GUID detection:
                if (isset($item['guid'])) {
                    $guid = $item['guid'];
                } else if (isset($item['id'])) {
                    $guid = $item['id'];
            $item['guid'] = $item['id'];
            } else {
                    $guid = $item['link'];
            $item['guid'] = $item['link'];
                }


Stats to keep:
stats for when a feed was last updated
when you last read something from it
when you last flagged something from it

Great keyboard nav idea:

Nice (but dojo-based) UI:

A simpler and jQuery based UI:

Add a Ubiquity verb:
CmdUtils.CreateCommand({
    name: "subscribe",
    description: "Subscribe to a feed for the current page in Google Reader",
    help: "Subscribe to a feed for the current page in Google Reader (does same thing as their bookmarklet)",
    execute: function(tags) {
        var document = context.focusedWindow.document;
        var b=document.body;
        var GR________bookmarklet_domain='http://www.google.com';
        if (b&&!document.xmlVersion) {
            void(z=document.createElement('script'));
            void(z.src='http://www.google.com/reader/ui/subscribe-bookmarklet.js');
            void(b.appendChild(z));
        } else {
            location = 'http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/' + encodeURIComponent(location.href);
        }
    }
})
